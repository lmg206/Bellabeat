## Google Data Analytics Course Case Study with R

As a recent graduate from Boston College, I wanted to learn more about data analysis so I completed Google's Data Analysis Certificate program this summer. This case study is the capstone project for the course and my first data analysis project!
I will be using the 6 phases of analysis (Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyse, Share and Act)to help guide my process.

#### Here's the Project Overview: 

**Scenario**
You are a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. 
Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. 
Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. 
You have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. 
The insights you discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. 
You will present your analysis to the Bellabeat executive team along with your high-level recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.

**Company**
Urška Sršen and Sando Mur founded Bellabeat, a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products. 
Sršen used her background as an artist to develop beautifully designed technology that informs and inspires women around the world. 
Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits. 
Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women.

**Products**
Bellabeat app: The Bellabeat app provides users with health data related to their activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits. This data can help users better understand their current habits and make healthy decisions. The Bellabeat app connects to their line of smart wellness products.
Leaf: Bellabeat’s classic wellness tracker can be worn as a bracelet, necklace, or clip. The Leaf tracker connects to the Bellabeat app to track activity, sleep, and stress.
Time: This wellness watch combines the timeless look of a classic timepiece with smart technology to track user activity, sleep, and stress. The Time watch connects to the Bellabeat app to provide you with insights into your daily wellness.
Spring: This is a water bottle that tracks daily water intake using smart technology to ensure that you are appropriately hydrated throughout the day. The Spring bottle connects to the Bellabeat app to track your hydration levels.
Bellabeat membership: Bellabeat also offers a subscription-based membership program for users. Membership gives users 24/7 access to fully personalized guidance on nutrition, activity, sleep, health and beauty, and mindfulness based on their lifestyle and goals.

**Business Task**
Sršen knows that an analysis of Bellabeat’s available consumer data would reveal more opportunities for growth. She has asked the marketing analytics team to focus on a Bellabeat product and 
analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices. 
Then, using this information, she would like high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy.
